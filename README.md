## Hi there 👋

### Aspiring Tech Professional | Data Enthusiast

### 🚀 About Me
I'm a Computer Science student at Dorset College Dublin, and I’ve always been passionate about solving problems and finding ways to make things run smoother—whether it's through data, tech tools, or coding.

Over the years, I learned to handle challenges under pressure and deliver results. Now, I’m diving deeper into Python, SQL, and data analysis to grow as a tech professional.
